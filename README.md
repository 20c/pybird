BIRD interface handler for Python

PyBird is a Python interface to the BIRD Internet Routing Daemon's UNIX control
socket, handling the socket connections and parsing the output. It was
originally written by [Sasha Romijn](https://github.com/mxsasha), forked from
the original BitBucket repository, and relicensed with permission.


In it's current state, you can use it to query the status of specific or all
BGP peers, to query the routes received, accepted and rejected from a peer,
or the general status of BIRD (router ID, last config change)


### Usage example

```py
    >>> from pybird import PyBird
    >>> pybird = PyBird(socket_file='/var/run/bird.ctl')
    >>> peer_state = pybird.get_peer_status('KPN')
    >>> peer_state['up']
    True
    >>> peer_state['import_updates_received']
    4214
    >>> peer_state['last_change']
    datetime.datetime(2011, 6, 19, 19, 57, 0, 0)

    >>> rejected = pybird.get_peer_prefixes_rejected('KPN')
    >>> rejected[0]['as_path']
    '23456 65592'
    
    >>> status = pybird.get_status()
    >>> status['last_reconfiguration_time']
    datetime.datetime(2012, 1, 3, 12, 46, 40)
    >>> status['router_id']
    "192.168.0.1"
```

You can also call ``get_peer_status()`` without a peer name, to get an array
with all the BGP peers.


### Example web server with cherrypy

Thanks to @martzuk

```py
import cherrypy
import json
from pybird import PyBird

class PybirdAPI(object):
    pybird = PyBird(socket_file='/run/bird.ctl')

    @cherrypy.expose
    def index(self):
        return "PybirdAPI"

    @cherrypy.expose
    def peer_state(self):
        peer_state = self.pybird.get_peer_status()
        return json.dumps(str(peer_state))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    cherrypy.quickstart(PybirdAPI())
```


### Full field list for peers

All fields that are decoded, if present:

- ``name``: Name as configured in BIRD
- ``protocol``: Currently always "BGP"
- ``last_change``: Last state change as a ``datetime.datetime`` object
- ``state``: String of the peer status, e.g. "Established" or "Passive"
- ``up``: Boolean, True if session is Established
- ``routes_imported``: Number of imported routes
- ``routes_exported``: Number of exported routes
- ``router_id``: BGP router id

And all combinations of:
``[import,export]_[updates,withdraws]_[received,rejected,filtered,ignored,accepted]``
which BIRD supports.


### Full field list for routes

All fields that are decoded, if present:

- ``origin``: BGP origin, e.g. "IGP"
- ``as_path``: AS path as string
- ``next_hop``: BGP next hop
- ``local_pref``: Local pref, e.g. '100'
- ``community``: Communities in string format, e.g. '8954:220 8954:620'

And any other BGP attribute fields BIRD has found.


### Full field list for BIRD status

- ``router_id``: BGP Router ID as string
- ``last_reboot``: Last BIRD restart time as datetime
- ``last_reconfiguration``: Last BIRD config change as datetime
- ``version``: BIRD version as string


### Test suite

There is a series of tests in ``tests.py``. This includes a ``MockBird``: a
mocked BIRD instance, with fixed but real responses, that listens on a real
UNIX socket. This means the tests do not only test parsing, but also socket
interaction.

#### Parsing tests

To automatically add parsing tests, just add `$test_name` with extensions
.input and .expected to the correct parsing directory under
<tests/data/parse/>.
