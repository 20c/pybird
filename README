==========================================
pybird - BIRD interface handler for Python
==========================================

PyBird is a Python interface to the BIRD Internet Routing Daemon's UNIX control
socket, handling the socket connections and parsing the output.

In it's current state, you can use it to query the status of specific or all
BGP peers.


Usage example
=============

::
    >>> from pybird import PyBird
    >>> pybird = PyBird(socket_file='/var/run/bird.ctl')
    >>> peer_state = pybird.get_peer_status('KPN')
    >>> peer_state['up']
    True
    >>> peer_state['import_updates_received']
    4214
    >>> peer_state['last_change']
    datetime.datetime(2011, 6, 19, 19, 57, 0, 0)

You can also call ``get_peer_status()`` without a peer name, to get an array
with all the BGP peers.

Full field list
===============

All fields that are decoded, if present:

- ``name``: Name as configured in BIRD
- ``protocol``: Currently always "BGP"
- ``last_change``: Last state change as a ``datetime.datetime`` object
- ``state``: String of the peer status, e.g. "Established" or "Passive"
- ``up``: Boolean, True if session is Established
- ``routes_imported``: Number of imported routes
- ``routes_exported``: Number of exported routes
- ``router_id``: BGP router id

And all combinations of:
``[import,export]_[updates,withdraws]_[received,rejected,filtered,ignored,accepted]``
which BIRD supports.


Test suite
==========

There is a series of tests in ``tests.py``. This includes a ``MockBird``: a
mocked BIRD instance, with fixed but real responses, that listens on a real
UNIX socket. This means the tests do not only test parsing, but also socket
interaction.
